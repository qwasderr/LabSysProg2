1-st automata: state 0 => state 0 on a
2-nd automata: state 0 => state 1 on a
state 0 of the 1-st automata and the state 1 of the second one are both non-final or final => next check

1-st automata: state 0 => state 1 on b
2-nd automata: state 0 => state -1 on b
For the second automata the final state isn't reachable from this position and for the first one it is
Witness: b+w, w belongs to A*
